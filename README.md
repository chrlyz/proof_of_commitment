# Proof Of Commitment

Mina smart contract that enables users of a service to deposit
funds in a contract, so the service provider is able to verify
which users have committed funds to the service, prioritizing
users accordingly, incentivized to provide a good service
so users agree to release funds later to the service provider.

The main purpose is to avoid slow and expensive on-chain transactions,
letting users and the service provider to keep score off-chain, settling
regularly, cultivating a symbiotic relationship.
